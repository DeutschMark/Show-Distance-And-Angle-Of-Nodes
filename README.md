# Show Distance And Angle

*This is a plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/).*  

It shows the direct distance of two selected elements (`Nodes, Anchors, Components`) and their angle. The times of temporaryly created guidelines are passé.

### Install

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Either:  
   Double click the `.glyphsReporter` file and confirm the dialogue in Glyphsapp to install.  
   Or:  
   Copy the `.glyphsReporter` into your Glyphsapp Plugins folder (eg. `/Library/Application\ Support/Glyphs/Plugins`). You can use subfolders (e.g. to sort plugins by author) there.
3. Restart Glyphs.

### How to use
